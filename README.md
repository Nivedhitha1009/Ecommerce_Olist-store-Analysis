## Overview of Project:

The Olist Store Analysis project aims to analyze customer purchasing patterns and payment statistics on an E-commerce platform, Olist. This project covers several key performance indicators (KPIs) such as weekday vs weekend sales, payment statistics, delivery time, and customer behavior. The analysis is based on nine CSV files, which are cleaned and manipulated to extract valuable insights.
 
## Description of Our source Data:

We chose the Brazilian-eCommerce dataset from ExcelR Solutions for our analysis. This dataset contains approximately 100,000 customer orders, along with corresponding files on product information and English translations of product categories originally in Portuguese. Nine files from the original ExcelR dataset were chosen for further analysis: 
A] olist_geolocation_dataset  

B] olist_customers_dataset

C] olist_sellers_dataset

D] olist_product_dataset

E] olist_order_items_dataset 

F] olist_orders_dataset 

G] olist_order_payments_dataset

H] olist_order_reviews_dataset

I] product_category_name_translation.

## Questions we hope to answer with our data:

with this Data we hope to Answer 5 different KPI's

1] Weekdays and weekend payment statistics ?

2] Payment Type with review score 5 ?

3] Average numbers of delivery days taken for pet shop ?

4] Average price and payment value of sao paulo city ?

5] Average shipping days vs review scores ?
 
## Data Modelling
 We used joins to create relationship between data tables in Power bi.The Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) below shows the connectivity between the 9 data tables used in our analysis.

The description of these tables is as follows:

olist_orders_dataset: This table is connected to 4 other tables. It is used to connect all the details related to an order.

olist_order_items_dataset: It contains the details of an item that had been purchased such as freight value, price and so on.

olist_order_reviews_dataset: It contains details related to any reviews posted by the customer on a particular product that he had purchased.

olist_products_dataset: It contains related to a product such as the Product ID, Product category name and measurements.

olist_order_payments_dataset: The information contained in this table is related to the payment details associated with a particular order type.

olist_customers_dataset: Details the customer base information of this firm.

olist_geolocation_dataset: It contains geographical information related to both the sellers and customers.

olist_sellers_dataset: This table contains the information related to all the sellers who have registered with this firm.

olist_product_category_name_translation: This table is connected to products database.

Individual datasets were cleaned using Power Query in a Power bi  before importing the data tables to  powerbi.
SQL left  joins were used to connect relevant  data tables for our My Sql.

## Step 1: Remove Blank And Null values 

1] I cleaned the data in Excel before importing it to PowerBI, I explored the data to find any inconsistencies, duplicates, incorrect format, or missing values. Iâ€™ll share some of the inconsistencies and incorrect format I found and how I corrected them, for example in the customer dataset city names were in lower case I used the proper formula and with the help of the helper column I replaced the values.  

2] In the orders dataset, there was some Null Values in order_purchase timestamp,order delivery customer date , and each order id is unique hence I removed those blank rows and remove duplicates . In this way, I cleaned the all 9 datasets and then imported the files into PowerBI.

3] In the product dataset, there was some empty product category name, and each product id is unique hence I removed those blank rows. In this way, I cleaned the dataset and then imported the files into PowerBI.

## Step 2:Merging Of Datasets

1] 




## Step 3: Transform 

1] After Cleaned all the files, I created some extra columns while referencing the order purchase timestamp column to get insight into the day, month, and year of order like day of week, weekend/weekday in the order dataset.

2] For calculating Shipping days With reference of Order purchase time stamp and Order deliver customer date i created customn column renamed to Shipping days in power query applied a formula and there after converted that custom column to Days by rightclick on the column 

3] in order to calculate Average Days with reference to order delivery customer table.duplicate the order delivary customer date column ,renamed to Delivery Days and finally tranform to days by right click on the column
